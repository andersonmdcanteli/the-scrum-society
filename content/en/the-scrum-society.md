In the vast expanse of Middle-earth, a mission of paramount importance arises: to **destroy the Ring of Power**, an artifact capable of *corrupting even the purest of hearts*. To this end, a diverse, cross-functional team is formed — a group that unexpectedly mirrors the structure and principles of an agile methodology known as Scrum. **This is the story of the Scrum Society**.

<br>

## The Ring of Power: The Product Vision and the Ultimate Purpose



{{< figure class="center" width=400 src="/img/the-scrum-society/the-ring-of-power.jfif" alt="The ring of Power" caption="Created with [**Image creator**](https://www.bing.com/images/create?)" >}}

At the heart of the mission is the Ring of Power, which, in the Scrum analogy, represents the **Product Vision**. This is the ultimate goal that guides all of the team’s efforts, a clear goal, but one that is fraught with challenges. Destroying the Ring is the only way to save Middle Earth from destruction, just as achieving a well-defined vision is essential to the success of a Scrum project. Frodo, the Ringbearer, becomes the **Product Owner (PO)** of this mission, carrying the vision and being responsible for ensuring that the team remains focused on the ultimate goal.

### Gandalf: The Scrum Master of Middle Earth


While Frodo carries the burden of the Product Vision, Gandalf takes on the role of **Scrum Master**. As a Scrum Master, Gandalf does not directly perform the work, but rather facilitates the team’s progress by removing obstacles and ensuring that everyone is aligned with the principles and values ​​of Scrum. His deep knowledge of Middle Earth, combined with his wisdom and leadership, make him the ideal guide for the Fellowship.

{{< figure class="center" width=400 src="/img/the-scrum-society/galdalf-smoking.jfif" alt="Gandalf smoking" caption="Created with [**Image creator**](https://www.bing.com/images/create?)" >}}

Gandalf is responsible for keeping the team united and focused, even in the face of the greatest challenges. He does not dictate the path, but rather empowers the team to make the best decisions, inspiring courage and resilience. When the Fellowship faces the Balrog in the depths of Moria, Gandalf sacrifices himself to ensure the team continues its mission—the ultimate and greatest impediment removal possible, demonstrating the ultimate commitment of a Scrum Master to the team’s success.


### The Fellowship: The Cross-Functional Development Team


{{< figure class="center" width=400 src="/img/the-scrum-society/the-fellowship.jfif" alt="the-fellowship" caption="Created with [**Image creator**](https://www.bing.com/images/create?)" >}}


The Fellowship of the Ring is comprised of members from diverse backgrounds and backgrounds, forming an ideal **Development Team** in the Scrum context. Each member brings a unique skill set to the team, similar to a Scrum team, where skill diversity is crucial to success.

- **Aragorn**: The natural leader, with combat and strategy skills, who also acts as a coach within the team, helping to coordinate and inspire the other members.
- **Legolas**: The agile and precise elf, whose archery skills and keen vision allow the team to maintain a tactical advantage in combat.
- **Gimli**: The robust dwarf, whose strength and determination are essential in the most difficult battles and in times of adversity.
- **Boromir**: A strong warrior, but whose internal struggle with the temptation of the Ring highlights the ethical and personal challenges that can arise in a project.
- **Sam**: The faithful squire, representing support and resilience, whose supporting role is crucial to Frodo's success, just as support between team members is essential in a Scrum.
- **Merry and Pippin**: They represent adaptability and the ability to surprise, contributing in unexpected ways that end up being vital to the success of the mission.


### The Product Backlog: Mapping the Journey

The mission to destroy the Ring is complex, requiring a clear list of tasks and challenges that need to be overcome—the **Product Backlog**. This backlog is carefully managed by Frodo, with the help of Gandalf and the Fellowship, prioritizing what needs to be done at each stage of the journey.

Some critical items in the backlog include:

- **Crossing the Misty Mountains**: An initial challenge where the team must decide the best route to cross the mountains.
- **Alliance with Rohan**: Convincing the kingdom of Rohan to unite against Sauron.
- **Defense of Gondor**: Preparing to defend the kingdom of Gondor against Sauron’s impending attack.
- **Entrance into Mordor**: Planning the final infiltration into the heart of enemy territory.

Each item in the backlog is complex and requires collaboration and strategy to execute. Frodo's vision as PO is to ensure that priorities are clear, always aligned with the ultimate goal: ***destroying the Ring***.


### Sprint Planning: Strategizing the Journey’s Steps


{{< figure class="center" width=400 src="/img/the-scrum-society/sprint-planning.jfif" alt="Sprint Planning" caption="Created with [**Image creator**](https://www.bing.com/images/create?)" >}}

At each new step of the journey, the Fellowship holds a sort of **Sprint Planning**, where they discuss and decide on the next steps. A prime example of this occurs when the Fellowship, after failing to cross the Misty Mountains, decides to take the dangerous path through Moria.

Here, all team members contribute their ideas and concerns, and, with Gandalf’s facilitation, they decide on the best approach. This collaborative planning process is essential to ensure that everyone is on the same page and that the team can move forward in a coordinated manner.

### Sprints: Breaking the Journey into Manageable Steps

{{< figure class="center" width=400 src="/img/the-scrum-society/sprint.jfif" alt="Sprint" caption="Created with [**Image creator**](https://www.bing.com/images/create?)" >}}

The journey to Mordor cannot be accomplished all at once. It is divided into **Sprints** — small mission steps that take the Fellowship ever closer to its ultimate goal. Each sprint has a clear and defined goal:

1. **Sprint 1: Departure from the Shire** - The team must get the Ring safely to Rivendell, where the Fellowship will be formed.

2. **Sprint 2: Crossing Moria** - The mission here is to cross the dangerous mines of Moria and reach Lothlórien.

3. **Sprint 3: Journey to Amon Hen** - The Fellowship must reach Amon Hen, where things start to get complicated and the team splits up.

In each sprint, the team faces obstacles, adapts to the circumstances, and makes progress toward the larger goal. This continuous cycle of planning, executing, and reviewing is the essence of Scrum in action.

### Daily Scrum: Daily Coordination and Alignment

Throughout the journey, the Fellowship has regular moments of pause and reflection—moments that serve as **Daily Scrums**. At these times, members discuss what has been accomplished so far, what needs to be done next, and the challenges they are facing. One example is when the Fellowship is camped out during the crossing, discussing the next move, sharing critical information, and adjusting their plans as needed.

These meetings are critical to ensuring that everyone is on the same page and that the mission continues to move forward in a coordinated and effective manner.

### Sprint Review: Reflecting on Progress


{{< figure class="center" width=400 src="/img/the-scrum-society/sprint-review.jfif" alt="The Fellowship is camped out" caption="Created with [**Image creator**](https://www.bing.com/images/create?)" >}}

At the end of each significant milestone, the Fellowship holds a **Sprint Review** of sorts. One example of this occurs in Lothlorien, after the crossing of Moria. The Fellowship gathers to reflect on what they have accomplished—they survived Moria, but they lost Gandalf. During this time, they also receive feedback from Galadriel, who provides insights and tools that will be crucial for the next steps.

These review moments allow the team to celebrate their achievements, identify areas for improvement, and prepare for upcoming challenges.

### Sprint Retrospective: Learning from Challenges

A **Sprint Retrospective** is when the Fellowship reflects on what could have been done differently. An example is the conversation between Frodo and Sam throughout their journey. They discuss their choices, the challenges they faced, and how they could have prepared better or made different decisions.

This ongoing reflection on the process is essential for the team’s growth and to ensure that they are always improving and adapting to new circumstances.


### The Role of Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli: Team Expansion and Strategic Alliances

{{< figure class="center" width=400 src="/img/the-scrum-society/aragorn-legolas-gimli.jfif" alt="Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli running in hilly fields." caption="Created with [**Image creator**](https://www.bing.com/images/create?)" >}}

With the split of the Fellowship after Amon Hen, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli form a new sub-team focused on missions that support the main objective. They seek allies, lead armies, and confront Sauron’s armies. Aragorn’s ability to assume a leadership role reflects the flexibility of Scrum, where team members can assume new roles as needed to achieve success.

Forming alliances with Rohan and Gondor is an example of how the Scrum team can expand its influence and collaborate with other stakeholders to ensure project success.

### The Final Showdown: The Great Battle and the Act of Courage

As Frodo and Sam approach Mordor, Aragorn leads the rest of the team in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields and later at the Black Gate. This big showdown is a **Final Sprint** to divert Sauron's attention, giving Frodo and Sam a chance to complete their mission. The battle is a metaphor for the most intense moments of a Scrum project, where all the team's effort is focused on overcoming a major obstacle.

### The Destruction of the Ring: The Final Increment and the Completion of the Quest

The climax of the journey occurs when Frodo and Sam finally reach Mount Doom. At the decisive moment, the Final Increment—the goal of destroying the Ring—is achieved, albeit in an unexpected way. Gollum, by biting Frodo’s finger and falling into the volcano with the Ring, accomplishes the task that Frodo could not complete alone. This moment highlights that even in Scrum, the final result can come in unexpected ways, and flexibility to deal with such surprises is essential.


{{< figure class="center" width=400 src="/img/the-scrum-society/gollum-falling.jfif" alt="Gollum falling into the volcano with The Ring" caption="Created with [**Image creator**](https://www.bing.com/images/create?)" >}}

With the destruction of the Ring, the **Definition of Done** is achieved, the quest is complete, and Middle-earth is freed from Sauron’s rule. This is the moment to deliver the Final Increment—the goal of the project has been successfully achieved.

### Epilogue: Return to the Shire and the Final Retrospective

After the quest is complete, the surviving members of the Fellowship return to the Shire. Here, they hold a final **Retrospective**, reflecting on the entire journey—the sacrifices, the achievements, the lessons learned. Frodo, in particular, realizes that while the mission was successful, he has been profoundly changed, carrying with him the scars of the process. This final reflection is a learning moment, where the team reviews what worked well, what could have been done differently, and how these lessons can be applied to future missions.

### The Legacy of the Sprint Fellowship

The Fellowship of the Ring’s mission leaves a lasting legacy in Middle-earth, just as a successful Scrum project can leave a lasting impact on an organization. Collaboration, mission-focused, constant adaptation, and the team’s commitment to the end goal are the pillars that led to the Fellowship’s success.
