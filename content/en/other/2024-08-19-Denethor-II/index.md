In the analogy of "The Sprint Society," Denethor II represents the role of an influential but potentially destabilizing stakeholder who wields significant authority over the project but whose views and behavior can undermine the progress and success of the Scrum Team. He symbolizes power figures within the organization who, because of their distorted perspective, fear of failure, or reluctance to accept change, can introduce impediments and conflicts that hinder project progress.

### The Role of Denethor II in the Analogy

#### 1. Destabilizing Leader

Denethor II is the Seneschal of Gondor, responsible for governing the city of Minas Tirith in the absence of the king. In Scrum, he represents a stakeholder or leader who, despite having great authority and responsibility, allows his distorted vision and negative attitudes to harm the project. He is an example of leadership that, instead of supporting the team, can undermine its morale and create obstacles due to lack of trust and resistance to change.

### 2. Example of Fearful and Self-Destructive Leadership

Denethor, consumed by hopelessness and limited vision, makes decisions that weaken Gondor's defense. In Scrum, he symbolizes a leader who, by giving in to pessimism and fear of failure, may make self-defeating decisions, such as resisting necessary changes, rejecting new ideas, or refusing to collaborate with other stakeholders, which can put the project at risk.

#### 3. The Internal Impediment

Denethor represents a type of impediment that does not come from outside, but from within the organization itself. His influence can create internal barriers, such as cultural resistance to change, power struggles, or decisions that are not aligned with the project goal, hindering the Scrum team's progress.



### Important Events and the Role of Denethor II

#### 1. Denial of Support (Lack of Alignment and Support for the Team)

Denethor II, by refusing to accept Rohan's help and to recognize Aragorn as the true king, symbolizes a stakeholder who is not aligned with the overall vision of the project and who, due to lack of trust or pride, withholds the necessary support. In Scrum, this can be seen as a stakeholder who does not fully support the project, does not provide the necessary resources or cooperation, which can lead to delays or failures.

- **Example in Scrum:** A senior leader who, due to distrust or resistance to change, withholds critical resources or refuses to collaborate, hindering the execution of the project.

#### 2. Using the Palantír (Distorted Vision of Reality)

Denethor uses the Palantír, a seeing stone, to try to predict the future, but his visions are distorted by Sauron, leading him to despair. This event symbolizes in Scrum a situation in which a leader or stakeholder bases their decisions on incomplete or distorted information, resulting in wrong choices that harm the project.

- **Example in Scrum:** A stakeholder who makes strategic decisions based on incorrect or misinterpreted data, generating a negative impact on the planning and execution of the project.

#### 3. Negligence During the Siege of Gondor (Lack of Support at Critical Moments)

During the siege of Gondor, Denethor becomes desperate and neglects his responsibilities, abandoning his post and leaving the city vulnerable. In Scrum, this represents a leader or stakeholder who, at critical moments in a project, fails to provide the necessary support, leaving the team without direction or resources at a crucial stage.

- **Example in Scrum:** A project leader who, during a critical phase, disengages or fails to provide the necessary support, leaving the team without direction at a time of need.

#### 4. The Attempt to Immolate Faramir (Self-Destructive Decisions)

Denethor, convinced that all is lost, attempts to burn himself and his son Faramir alive, symbolizing self-destructive leadership that can lead to decisions that seriously compromise the project and those involved. In Scrum, this can be seen as actions or decisions by a stakeholder who, in desperation, takes actions that harm not only the project, but also the people involved.

- **Example in Scrum:** A stakeholder who, upon sensing that the project is at risk, makes rash and self-destructive decisions, such as cutting resources, abandoning the project, or taking actions that harm the team.

### Denethor II as the Destabilizing Stakeholder Archetype in Scrum

Denethor II, in the Sprint Society, is the personification of a stakeholder or leader who, due to fear, pessimism, or a distorted view of reality, becomes a significant impediment to the Scrum team. He represents the internal challenges that arise from within the organization itself, including resistance to change, lack of support, and self-destructive decisions that can jeopardize the success of the project.

He symbolizes the risks of negative leadership and the importance of maintaining a clear vision, consistent support, and a collaborative approach in Scrum. Like Denethor, such figures can, through their actions or inactions, create significant obstacles that the team must overcome in order to achieve success.

> In the analogy of “The Sprint Society,” Denethor II is the influential and potentially destabilizing stakeholder who, out of fear and distorted vision, makes decisions that harm the Scrum Team and threaten the success of the project. He represents the internal challenges, including resistance to change and negative leadership, that the team must face and overcome to ensure that the project achieves its goals.
