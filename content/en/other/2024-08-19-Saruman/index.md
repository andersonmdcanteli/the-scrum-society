In the analogy of "The Sprint Fellowship," Saruman represents the role of **a negative archetype of a leader or former Scrum member who, instead of contributing to the success of the project, deviates from core values, seeks power and control at the expense of the well-being of the team, and attempts to manipulate the process for his own ends**. He symbolizes the danger of corruption, loss of focus on the team's goals, and practices that run counter to Scrum principles such as transparency, collaboration, and respect.

### Saruman's Role in the Analogy

#### 1. The Corrupt and Manipulative Leader

Saruman is originally a wise leader, but his lust for power and desire to control the fate of Middle-earth leads him to betray his allies and ally himself with Sauron. In Scrum, he represents a leader who, instead of supporting the team and the goals of the project, becomes corrupted by power and manipulates the process for personal gain, creating a toxic and adversarial environment.

#### 2. The Former Mentor Who Went Astray

Saruman was one of the most respected leaders and a mentor to Gandalf, but his downfall reveals how even the wisest can go astray when they lose sight of the values ​​they are supposed to uphold. In Scrum, he symbolizes a former team member or leader who, despite having been a mentor or positive influence, strays from the principles of Scrum, causing harm to the team and the project.

#### 3. The Anti-Scrum Archetype

Saruman, in his quest for power, tries to control everything and everyone around him, in direct contrast to the principles of Scrum, which value team self-organization, transparency, and continuous adaptation. He represents the forces that oppose the collaborative and agile spirit of Scrum.


### Important Events and the Role of Saruman

#### 1. Alliance with Sauron (Loss of Vision and Alignment)

Saruman initially seeks to resist Sauron, but is eventually seduced by power and decides to ally himself with the Dark Lord, believing he can control him. In Scrum, this represents a leader or team member who loses sight of the project goals and team values, aligning themselves with practices that erode the team culture and compromise the success of the project.

- **Example in Scrum:** A leader who, instead of promoting agile and collaborative practices, begins to impose a rigid, centralizing and controlling management style, ignoring team feedback and pursuing personal or short-term goals at the expense of the team's health and cohesion.

### 2. Theoden's Manipulation (Toxic Influence)

Saruman uses Gríma Wormtongue to poison King Theoden's mind, weakening and controlling him for his own ends. In Scrum, this can symbolize a leader or team member who manipulatively influences other members, undermining trust, transparency, and collaboration within the team.

- **Scrum example:** A team member or leader who manipulates information or uses undue influence to divide the team, create distrust, or distort others' perceptions of the project's progress.

#### 3. The Building of Isengard and the Uruk-hai (Focus on Control and Domination)

Saruman transforms Isengard into a fortress of power and creates the Uruk-hai, an army destined to dominate his enemies, in a clear violation of the values ​​of balance and harmony that he once championed. In Scrum, this represents the act of a leader who moves away from agile and collaborative practices to implement rigid and oppressive methods, aiming only at control and domination, rather than promoting the growth and success of the team.

- **Example in Scrum:** A leader who decides to abandon the ceremonies and practices of Scrum in favor of strict command and control, centralizing all decisions and disregarding the feedback and self-organization of the team.

#### 4. The Defeat and Fall of Saruman (Consequences of Corruption)

Eventually, Saruman is defeated by the forces of the alliance, and his fall serves as a warning about the dangers of unbridled ambition and betrayal. In Scrum, this represents the inevitable consequences for those who stray from the core values ​​of Scrum and attempt to impose a destructive or self-serving leadership style.

- **Example in Scrum:** A leader or team member who, after causing division, demotivation and failure in the project, is eventually removed or replaced, allowing the team to return to the path of agile and collaborative values.

### Saruman as the Anti-Scrum Archetype

Saruman, in the Sprint Society, is the personification of the leader or team member who, seduced by power and control, deviates from the values ​​and principles of Scrum, causing destruction and chaos in the process. He represents the danger of corruption, manipulation and loss of vision, serving as an example of what happens when the collaborative, transparent and adaptive spirit of Scrum is abandoned.

He symbolizes the need to maintain focus on the core values ​​of Scrum, such as transparency, adaptation and collaboration, and constant vigilance against practices that could compromise the integrity and success of the project. The story of Saruman is a cautionary tale about the corrupting power of unbridled ambition and loss of vision, reminding us of the importance of leaders who foster collective growth, trust, and success.

> In the analogy of “The Sprint Society,” Saruman is the archetypal corrupt and manipulative leader, an example of what happens when Scrum values ​​are abandoned in favor of power and control. He represents the dangers of anti-Scrum practices such as excessive centralization of power, manipulation, and the pursuit of personal goals at the expense of the team’s well-being. Saruman’s story serves as a reminder that the success of Scrum depends on adherence to its values ​​and principles, and that losing that focus can lead to failure and destruction.
