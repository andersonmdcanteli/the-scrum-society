In the analogy of “The Sprint Society,” Éomer represents the role of **a member of the development team or an external stakeholder who may initially be seen as an obstacle or risk factor, but who proves to be a powerful ally, providing critical support and resources when needed most**. He symbolizes those individuals or groups who, although initially marginalized or undervalued, demonstrate great value and commitment throughout the project, helping to overcome significant challenges.

### Éomer's Role in the Analogy

#### 1. The Marginalized Ally

Éomer begins his journey as leader of the Riders of Rohan, but is removed from the center of power by Gríma Wormtongue, who considers him a threat. In Scrum, he symbolizes a team member or stakeholder who, despite being underestimated or excluded, has the skills, resources, and will to contribute decisively to the success of the project.

#### 2. The Decisive Reinforcement

Éomer emerges as an essential reinforcement at critical moments in the saga, leading his forces decisively. In Scrum, he represents those who, even outside the core of the team, offer crucial support that can change the course of the project, especially in crisis situations.

#### 3. The Defender of Justice and Integrity

Éomer is a warrior committed to justice and the protection of his people, resisting the corruption of Gríma Wormtongue. In Scrum, he symbolizes the defender of fair and transparent practices within the team, someone who fights against negative influence and ensures that the project remains aligned with its core values.


### Important Events and Éomer’s Role

#### 1. Marginalization and Exile (Early Challenges)

Éomer is removed from his position and imprisoned by Gríma Wormtongue, representing a team member or stakeholder who faces resistance or exclusion but remains committed to the success of the project. In Scrum, this can symbolize situations where a team member or important ally is undervalued or ignored, but has the potential to make a significant difference.

- **Example in Scrum:** A developer or expert who is initially ignored or not consulted in critical decisions, but who, when called upon, offers insights or solutions that change the course of the project.

### 2. Meeting Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli (First Team Contact)

Éomer meets Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli on their patrol and, despite being wary, provides them with horses and vital information. This moment symbolizes the first positive interaction between an external stakeholder and the Scrum team, where collaboration begins to take shape, albeit tentatively.

- **Example in Scrum:** A situation in which an ally external to the Scrum team, perhaps from another area or even a consultant, provides important support that helps the team solve a problem or move the project forward.

#### 3. The Battle of Helm's Deep (Support at Critical Moments)

Éomer plays a crucial role in the Battle of Helm's Deep, arriving with reinforcements at just the right moment to turn the tide of the battle. In Scrum, this represents the decisive support that a team member or external stakeholder can offer in a moment of crisis, helping the project overcome a major obstacle.

- **Scrum example:** A moment during a project when the team faces a significant challenge, and an undervalued member or external stakeholder steps in with resources, expertise, or support that are critical to success.

#### 4. The Cavalry of Rohan at Minas Tirith (Alliance Strengthened)

Éomer, now recognized as the leader of the Riders of Rohan, leads his forces into the Battle of Minas Tirith, demonstrating the power of a strong and well-led alliance. In Scrum, this symbolizes the phase in which a previously undervalued external stakeholder or team member becomes a recognized and essential leader whose contribution is crucial to the success of the project.

- **Scrum example:** A stakeholder or leader who, after having been undervalued, gains recognition and becomes central to the strategy and execution of the project, leading the team at decisive moments.

### Éomer as the Undervalued Ally Archetype in Scrum

Éomer, in the Sprint Society, is the embodiment of the undervalued ally who, despite obstacles and marginalization, demonstrates great value and commitment throughout the project. He represents those team members or stakeholders who, initially ignored or sidelined, prove decisive in times of greatest need, providing critical support that can change the fate of the project.

He symbolizes the importance of recognizing the value of all team members and external stakeholders, understanding that, in times of crisis, unexpected allies can provide the support needed for success. Éomer’s story is a reminder that the true potential of a team or project often lies in the diversity of contributions and the ability to join forces in times of need.

> In the analogy of “The Sprint Society,” Éomer is the undervalued ally who, despite facing resistance and marginalization, emerges as a decisive force in the most critical moments. He represents the power of a well-led alliance and the importance of recognizing and valuing the support of all members and stakeholders, especially those who may at first glance be underestimated. His journey is an illustration of how unexpected contributions and support at key moments can make the difference between success and failure of a project.
