title: Gollum as external and unforeseen forces
---

Gollum plays a multifaceted and ambiguous role. He can be seen as a representation of the external and unforeseen forces that affect a Scrum project, as well as an uncertain or unstable stakeholder who has a significant, but often negative, influence on the progress of the project.

### Gollum’s Role in the Analogy

#### 1. External and Unforeseen Force

![](gollum-duality.jfif)

Gollum is an external force that unexpectedly impacts the progress of the mission. In a Scrum context, this could represent sudden changes in market conditions, technical setbacks, or other external influences that affect the progress of the project but are not necessarily directly part of the team.

#### 2. Unstable Stakeholder

Gollum can also be seen as a stakeholder who has an interest in the success of the project (destruction of the Ring), but who has conflicting motivations and acts in unpredictable ways. He wants the Ring for himself, but also, at times, helps Frodo and Sam, reflecting stakeholders who can sometimes help, but also harm the project depending on their own intentions and priorities.

### Important Events and Gollum's Role

#### 1. The Introduction of Gollum (Unexpected Risk)

Gollum is introduced into the story as a threat, following Frodo and Sam on their journey to Mordor. Initially, he is an external force that poses a risk to the project, a shadowy figure who can divert the mission from its course. In a Scrum project, this can be compared to unforeseen risks that appear without warning and need to be managed.

#### 2. Capture and Temporary Alliance (Stakeholder Influencing the Path)

When Frodo and Sam capture Gollum, he becomes a temporary ally. Frodo decides to trust Gollum to guide the path to Mordor, symbolizing how a Product Owner or Scrum team may need to involve a difficult but necessary stakeholder to achieve the goal. The alliance is fragile, and Frodo’s trust in Gollum is a calculated risk, reflecting decisions that project leaders sometimes have to make when dealing with unstable stakeholders.

#### 3. The Path to Mordor (Interference and Ambiguous Support)

![](gollum-eating-fish.jfif)

Throughout the journey, Gollum alternates between helping and hindering Frodo and Sam. He guides them through secret paths, avoiding dangers that they could not overcome alone, which can be seen as a stakeholder who offers valuable insights or resources that help the project. However, his loyalties are dubious, and he often tries to sabotage the quest to obtain the Ring for himself, representing stakeholders who may attempt to divert the project to suit their own interests.

#### 4. The Betrayal at Cirith Ungol (Stakeholder-Created Impediment)

Gollum betrays Frodo and Sam by leading them to Shelob's lair, an ambush that nearly results in Frodo's death. This event reflects the reality of when a difficult stakeholder or outside force creates a significant obstacle to the project that the team must overcome. Here, Gollum represents the danger of blindly trusting stakeholders who have hidden motives.

#### 5. The Climax at Mount Doom (Final, Unexpected Impact on the Project)

At the crucial moment at Mount Doom, Gollum plays an unexpected and pivotal role. When Frodo, unable to destroy the Ring, succumbs to its influence, it is Gollum who, in his obsession, bites Frodo's finger and falls with the Ring into the lava, resulting in the Ring's destruction. This moment symbolizes how external factors or difficult stakeholders can, in unforeseen ways, contribute to the completion of a project, even if unintentionally or unplanned.

Gollum here is the personification of uncertainty and risk that, even if poorly managed or adverse, can, paradoxically, lead to the success of the project. The destruction of the Ring, although carried out by Gollum in an accidental manner, still fulfills the ultimate goal of the mission, highlighting the need to be prepared for surprises, both good and bad, during the life cycle of a project.

### The Duality of Gollum as a Force and Stakeholder

Throughout the saga, Gollum is a figure of duality—he is both a chaotic force and a stakeholder with conflicting interests. In the context of Scrum, he teaches the importance of managing risk, being aware of external influences, and dealing with complex stakeholders. His constant presence and the uncertainty he brings to the mission show how projects can be impacted by factors outside the team’s direct control, and how resilience and adaptability are essential to ultimate success.

> Gollum in the Sprint Society represents the unpredictable elements and difficult stakeholders that can interfere with the progress of a project. His complexity, driven by a combination of obsession, necessity, and betrayal, exemplifies how external forces and stakeholders can both help and hinder, and how the success of a project often depends on the team’s ability to navigate these influences with wisdom and flexibility.







In the analogy of “The Sprint Society,” Gollum plays **the role of a former team member or stakeholder who, after leaving or being excluded, continues to exert a persistent and ambiguous influence on the project**. He represents **the risks and rewards of expertise that has become corrupted or obsessed, and that can either help or hinder the progress of the Scrum Team**. His duality, between being helpful and treacherous, exemplifies the challenges of dealing with external influences or figures from the past who have a complex relationship to the project goal.

### **Gollum’s Role in the Analogy**

#### **1. The Obsessive Knower (Corrupted Expertise)**
Gollum is a figure who, despite his corruption and obsession with the One Ring, possesses a profound knowledge of it and of hidden paths that others are unaware of. In Scrum, it represents expertise that, while valuable, has been corrupted or distorted over time, and that can either guide the team at critical moments or lead it astray.

#### **2. The Duality of Intentions (The Ambiguity of Influence)**
Gollum has a dual nature: he is both Smeagol, who wants to help, and Gollum, who seeks to betray and recover the Ring for himself. In Scrum, this symbolizes the ambiguous influence of a former member or stakeholder who can alternate between supporting the team and sabotaging it, depending on his motivations and interests.

#### **3. The Untrustworthy Guide (Leading on Risky Paths)**
Despite his treacherous nature, Gollum guides Frodo and Sam on paths that no one else knows, such as the passage through Cirith Ungol. In Scrum, it represents the risk and opportunity of following advice or direction from a figure who has unique knowledge but whose intentions are questionable.


### **Important Events and Gollum’s Role**

#### **1. The First Encounter with Frodo and Sam (The Introduction of Ambiguous Influence)**
Frodo and Sam encounter Gollum, who follows them on their journey until he is finally captured and, for a time, cooperates with them. In Scrum, this symbolizes the moment when a former project figure, perhaps someone with deep knowledge but who has been removed for some reason, is reintroduced to the team. This figure can provide valuable insights, but also poses a risk due to their ambiguous intentions.

- **Example in Scrum:** A former team member or consultant who has been brought back to the project to provide insight into a critical aspect of the product. While their expertise is undeniable, their commitment to the team’s success may be questionable.

### **2. The Journey to Mordor (Gollum's Dependence on Knowledge)**
Gollum guides Frodo and Sam on their journey to Mordor, especially through paths such as the Dead Marshes and Cirith Ungol. In Scrum, this represents the team's dependence on expertise that, while necessary at certain critical moments, also carries risks due to the unpredictable nature of the source of this knowledge.

- **Example in Scrum:** The Scrum team depends on specific knowledge of a technology or market that only a consultant or long-time team member possesses. While this dependence is necessary to overcome certain obstacles, there is a constant risk that this figure could lead the team down dangerous or less efficient paths.

#### **3. The Attempted Betrayal (The Risk of Sabotage)**
Gollum eventually tries to betray Frodo and Sam, leading them to Shelob's lair, where he hopes to kill them so that he can retrieve the Ring. In Scrum, this represents the ongoing risk that an ambiguous influence or figure from the past may, at critical moments, attempt to sabotage the progress of the project to serve their own interests.

- **Example in Scrum:** An external consultant or stakeholder who, at a critical moment, makes a recommendation or action that jeopardizes the success of the project, either out of self-interest or because of a lack of alignment with the team’s goals.

#### **4. Retrieving the Ring (The Cycle of Obsession and Failure)**
In the end, Gollum recovers the Ring, but his obsession leads to its destruction. In Scrum, this symbolizes the way in which the influence of a former member or corrupted expertise can lead to a temporary victory, but can have disastrous consequences for both the individual and the project.

- **Example in Scrum:** A former team member who, through manipulation or underhanded tactics, manages to impose his vision or approach on the project, but in the long run leads the project to failure due to a lack of alignment with the true goals and values ​​of Scrum.

### **Gollum as the Archetype of Ambiguous Influence in Scrum**

Gollum, in the Sprint Society, is the symbol of the ambiguous and potentially dangerous influence that a past figure or corrupted expert can exert on a Scrum team. He represents the duality between the value of expertise and the risks associated with hidden agendas or selfish motivations.

His story is a cautionary tale about the importance of recognizing and managing these influences carefully, ensuring that the team does not become overly dependent on knowledge that, while valuable, can lead the project down dangerous paths if not properly controlled.

In the analogy of “The Sprint Society,” Gollum is the archetype of ambiguous influence and the risk associated with corrupted expertise. He personifies the challenges of dealing with longtime team members or consultants who, while possessing deep and valuable knowledge, have dubious intentions or hidden agendas that can undermine the success of the project. Gollum’s story is a powerful reminder of the importance of carefully monitoring and controlling these influences, ensuring that the team remains aligned with its core goals and values, and avoiding the trap of going down paths that could compromise the long-term success of the project.
