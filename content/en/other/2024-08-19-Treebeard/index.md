### **Treebeard’s Role in the Analogy**

#### **1. The Keeper of Ancient Wisdom**
Treebeard is an ancient being whose life and experience span the ages of Middle Earth. In Scrum, he symbolizes a mentor or senior leader who possesses vast experience and deep knowledge of agile principles and practices. This figure plays a crucial role in helping the team stay connected to the core values ​​of Scrum, ensuring that decisions are made based on sound principles and a deep understanding of what is truly important for the success of the project.

#### **2. The Importance of Natural Rhythm**
Treebeard represents a slower, more natural pace that contrasts with the rush and urgency of Middle-earth battles. In Scrum, he embodies the importance of respecting the team’s work pace, recognizing that certain tasks and decisions require time for reflection and maturation, ensuring that actions are well-founded and sustainable in the long term.

#### **3. The Decisive Action Agent**
Despite his deliberate nature, Treebeard demonstrates that when convinced of the need, he can act decisively and powerfully, as in the Ents’ march against Isengard. In Scrum, it symbolizes the ability of a mentor or senior leader to catalyze change and decisive action at the right time, mobilizing the team to face significant challenges when the situation demands it.


### **Important Events and Treebeard’s Role**

#### **1. Meeting Merry and Pippin (Mentoring and Introduction to Ancient Wisdom)**
When Merry and Pippin meet Treebeard, they are introduced to a completely new perspective on Middle-earth, learning about the Ents and their history. In Scrum, this represents the role of a mentor who introduces younger or inexperienced team members to practices and knowledge that has been accumulated over time, providing them with a solid foundation for their work on the project.

- **Example in Scrum:** An Agile Coach or experienced leader who takes the time to educate new team members, sharing lessons learned, effective practices, and a deep understanding of Agile principles, enriching the team’s ability to deliver high-quality work.

### **2. The Deliberation of the Ents (Wisdom-Based Decision Making)**
Treebeard calls a meeting of the Ents to discuss the war in Middle-earth, a deliberate and thoughtful process. In Scrum, this symbolizes the importance of thoughtful discussion and decision-making based on collective experience and wisdom, especially when it comes to strategic decisions that impact the future of the project.

- **Scrum example:** A team that, rather than acting impulsively, takes the time to conduct a detailed retrospective or strategic planning session, consulting collective experience to make informed decisions that will direct the next sprint or the overall strategy of the project.

#### **3. The March of the Ents (Decisive Action in Response to Critical Needs)**
Convinced of Saruman’s threat, Treebeard leads the Ents on a march to destroy Isengard, demonstrating the power and determination of the Ents when mobilized. In Scrum, this represents the role of a mentor or leader who, upon perceiving a critical need, mobilizes the team to take decisive action, overcoming major challenges and eliminating significant obstacles.

- **Example in Scrum:** A Scrum Master or senior leader who, faced with a project crisis, such as a critical blockage or a threat to the integrity of the product, mobilizes the team with urgency and directs focused efforts to resolve the issue, ensuring that the project continues to move forward.

#### **4. Protecting the Forest (Preserving Values ​​and Culture)**
Treebeard and the Ents are deeply connected to the forest and are dedicated to protecting it from threats. In Scrum, this can symbolize the role of a mentor or leader in preserving the values ​​and culture of the team, ensuring that, even under pressure, the fundamental principles of Scrum and Agile are not compromised.

- **Example in Scrum:** A leader who, during a project, makes a point of keeping the team aligned with agile values, resisting pressure to adopt practices that could compromise the quality or integrity of the work, and ensuring that the team operates within an environment that values ​​collaboration, transparency, and mutual respect.

### **Treebeard as the Archetype of the Wise Mentor and Catalyst in Scrum**

Treebeard, in the Sprint Society, is the symbol of the wise mentor and senior leader who brings a perspective rich in experience and deep knowledge of the fundamentals of Scrum. He represents the importance of respecting the natural rhythm of work, ensuring that decisions are well-considered and based on sound principles. In addition, Treebeard exemplifies the crucial role of a mentor in catalyzing decisive action at the right time, mobilizing the team to face critical challenges with power and determination.

He also embodies the role of guardian of values ​​and culture, ensuring that the Scrum team remains true to its core principles even in the face of great challenges or external pressures. Treebeard’s story is a reminder that in Scrum, accumulated wisdom and experience are invaluable resources, able to guide the team through complexity and uncertainty while keeping the focus on what truly matters for long-term success.
