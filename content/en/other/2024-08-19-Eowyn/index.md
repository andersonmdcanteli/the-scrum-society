### Éowyn's Role in the Analogy

#### 1. The Determined and Courageous Member

Éowyn is a figure who fights against the limitations imposed on her, wanting to prove her worth and protect those she loves. In Scrum, she represents a team member or stakeholder who, despite not being immediately recognized as central to the success of the project, has the determination and skill to overcome significant challenges and contribute decisively.

#### 2. The Champion of Initiative and Courage

Éowyn symbolizes the ability to take the lead in critical situations, even when she is not expected to do so. In Scrum, this represents the importance of encouraging and recognizing initiative within the team, allowing all members to contribute according to their skills and courage, especially when the project faces major obstacles.

#### 3. The Challenger of Norms and Expectations

In the saga, Éowyn challenges the norms of her society, which expect her to stay on the sidelines of battles. In Scrum, she represents the breaking down of barriers and expectations within the team, showing that any member, regardless of their formal role, can contribute significantly to the success of the project.

### Important Events and Éowyn’s Role

#### 1. The Struggle to Participate (Overcoming Initial Limitations)

Éowyn, initially limited by her position as a lady of Rohan, yearns passionately to participate in the battle to protect her land and people. In Scrum, this symbolizes team members or stakeholders who, despite being initially seen as non-essential or relegated to less visible roles, have the desire and ability to contribute more actively.

- **Example in Scrum:** A team member who, although in a supporting or secondary role, demonstrates initiative and proposes solutions or volunteers to address challenges that are outside of their direct responsibility.

### 2. The Battle of Helm’s Deep (Active Participation and Courage)

Although Éowyn does not directly participate in the Battle of Helm’s Deep, she stands firm in Rohan, caring for her people and wanting to be on the front lines. In Scrum, this represents the determination and readiness to actively participate in the project, even when not directly involved, always looking for opportunities to contribute.

- **Example in Scrum:** A team member or stakeholder who, although not directly involved in a critical task, provides active support and is prepared to help in any area needed.

#### 3. The Battle of the Pelennor Fields (Decisive Action at Critical Moments)

Éowyn disguises herself as a warrior and participates in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, where she plays a crucial role in confronting and defeating the Witch-king of Angmar. This moment represents, in Scrum, a decisive action by a team member who, even though not expected to take on such responsibility, intervenes in a critical way to resolve a major impediment or challenge.

- **Scrum example:** A team member who, in a moment of crisis, takes the lead or solves a critical problem that seemed insurmountable, demonstrating that everyone's contribution should be valued.

#### 4. Exceeding Expectations (Final Recognition)

After defeating the Witch-king, Éowyn is recognized for her valor and courage, breaking the expectations that a woman could not fulfill such a role. In Scrum, this symbolizes the recognition that all team members have the potential to make significant contributions, and that the success of a project depends on the ability to identify and leverage these unique skills.

- **Scrum example:** The recognition that an undervalued team member or stakeholder played a crucial role in the success of the project, leading to a change in the way the team recognizes and values ​​all contributions.

### Éowyn as the Archetype of Initiative and Courage in Scrum

She represents the power of individual initiative and courage to overcome great challenges and contribute to the success of the project.

She symbolizes the importance of recognizing that the value of each team member can manifest itself in unexpected moments, and that it is crucial to allow everyone the opportunity to excel and contribute meaningfully. Her story is a reminder that in Scrum, the potential to make a difference is present in every team member, and that diversity of skills and perspectives is one of the greatest strengths of a team.
