## Scrum

- **[Daily Scrum](../events/2024-08-19-daily-scrum/)**: Daily, quick meetings (15 minutes) where the Scrum team aligns on progress, identifies obstacles, and adjusts the plan for the day. In the analogy, it is compared to the Society's daily discussions and coordination on the progress of the journey.

- **Development Team**: The cross-functional group responsible for delivering product increments during Sprints. In the analogy, the members of the Fellowship of the Ring (Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Boromir) represent the development team, each with their own specific skills that contribute to the success of the mission.

- **[Increment](../events/2024-08-19-increments/)**: The result of each Sprint, an increase in the product that is potentially releasable. In the analogy, each significant step forward the Fellowship takes toward the destruction of the Ring is considered an increment.

- **[Product Backlog](../events/2024-08-19-product-backlog/)**: An ordered list of everything that is needed for the product, managed by the Product Owner. In the analogy, it is compared to the journey map, where all the steps and challenges to be faced are recorded.

- **[Product Owner (PO)](../product-owner/)**: The person responsible for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Scrum team. The PO prioritizes the Product Backlog and ensures that the team is always working on the highest-value item. In the analogy, Frodo is compared to the PO, as he carries the Ring, which represents the ultimate goal of the mission.

- **Scrum**: An agile framework used to manage complex projects, especially in software development. Scrum promotes the delivery of value in an iterative and incremental manner, with a focus on rapid adaptation and continuous improvement.

- **[Scrum Master](../scrum-master)**: The facilitator of the Scrum team, responsible for ensuring that Scrum is understood and applied correctly. The Scrum Master removes impediments and helps the team self-organize. In the analogy, Gandalf is compared to the Scrum Master, guiding and supporting the Fellowship in its mission.


- **[Sprint](../events/2024-08-19-sprints/)**: A fixed period of time (usually 1 to 4 weeks) during which a Scrum Team works to complete a set of tasks with the goal of creating a usable increment of the product. In the analogy, each Sprint corresponds to a phase or stage of the journey of the Fellowship of the Ring.

- **[Sprint Planning](../events/2024-08-19-sprint-planning/)**: A meeting at the beginning of each Sprint where the Scrum Team decides which Product Backlog items will be prioritized and how they will be worked on during the Sprint. In the analogy, it represents the strategic planning of each stage of the Society's journey.


- **[Sprint Retrospective](../events/2024-08-19-sprint-retrospective/)**: A meeting held at the end of each Sprint to reflect on what worked well, what can be improved, and how the team can improve in the next Sprints. In the analogy, it symbolizes the Society's reflection on the challenges faced and lessons learned.


- **[Sprint Review](../events/2024-08-19-sprint-review/)**: Meeting held at the end of each Sprint where the product increment is reviewed and feedback is received from stakeholders. In the analogy, it reflects the moments in which the Society evaluates its progress and adjusts its plans.
