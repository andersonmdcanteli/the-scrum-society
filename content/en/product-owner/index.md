> *"I will take the Ring, though I do not know the way".*

As Product Owner, Frodo takes responsibility for the end goal (destroying the Ring), even without knowing exactly how to achieve that result, reflecting the uncertainty a PO faces when guiding a project.

> *"I wish the Ring had never come to me. I wish none of this had happened".*

Expresses the burden of carrying the project's end goal, similar to the PO who often feels the weight of critical decisions that must be made.

Frodo Baggins takes on the crucial role of Product Owner (PO), **the character who carries the Ring of Power, *the central objective* of the entire mission**. As PO, Frodo is responsible for keeping the team focused on destroying the Ring, which represents the Product Vision—the ultimate purpose of the project.

In the analogy of "The Sprint Society," Frodo Baggins assumes the crucial role of **Product Owner (PO)**, the character who carries the Ring of Power, the central goal of the entire mission. As PO, Frodo is responsible for keeping the team focused on destroying the Ring, which represents the **Product Vision**—the ultimate purpose of the project.

## Frodo's Role as Product Owner

### 1. Vision and Goal

Frodo carries the Ring of Power, which symbolizes the clear and unwavering vision of the product: the destruction of the Ring in Mordor. Just as the PO must ensure that everyone on the team understands and works toward the product vision, Frodo is committed to carrying the Ring to Mount Doom, despite the dangers and corruption it entails.

### 2. Product Backlog Management

Throughout the journey, Frodo acts as the keeper of the backlog, a list of objectives and tasks that need to be accomplished to achieve the ultimate goal. Each location the Fellowship visits and each challenge they face—such as crossing the Misty Mountains, going through the Mines of Moria, or infiltrating Mordor—represents items in the backlog that Frodo must prioritize and decide how to approach.

### 3. Prioritization and Decision Making

Frodo constantly makes critical decisions about how the quest should progress, reflecting the PO’s responsibility to prioritize items in the backlog. One example of this is when he decides to continue on to Moria after the hardships in the Misty Mountains, weighing the risks and benefits of each path. Later, when the Fellowship splits, Frodo decides to go it alone with Sam, showing his adaptability and focus on the main quest.

### 4. Representation of Stakeholders

As the PO, Frodo also symbolizes the connection to the stakeholders, which in this case would be the free peoples of Middle-earth who depend on the success of the quest. He carries not only the burden of the Ring, but also the hopes of all those fighting against Sauron. His empathy, responsibility, and commitment to these stakeholders drive him to continue, even when the mission seems impossible.



## Important Events and Frodo's Role

### 1. The Departure from the Shire (Sprint 1)

At the beginning, Frodo accepts the role of Ringbearer (PO) and begins the journey. He leads the first sprint, taking the Ring from Bag End to Rivendell, facing dangers such as the Nazgûl and receiving guidance from Gandalf.

### 2. The Crossing of Moria (Sprint 2)


{{< figure class="center" src="/img/frodo/frodo-tired.jfif" alt="Frodo tired due to the hard journey." caption="Created with [**Image creator**](https://www.bing.com/images/create?)" >}}


Frodo participates in the decision to cross Moria, a calculated risk after failing to cross the Misty Mountains. At this point, he already begins to feel the weight of the Ring, reflecting the difficulties a PO can face in maintaining the product vision in the midst of increasing challenges.

### 3. The Parting at Amon Hen (Sprint 3)

When the Fellowship splits, Frodo decides to move forward with Sam, recognizing that the ultimate mission is more important than the unity of the group. This critical decision illustrates the PO’s ability to make difficult decisions in favor of the ultimate goal.


### 4. The Journey to Mordor (Final Sprints)

Frodo and Sam’s trek to Mordor is a marathon of endurance and focus. Frodo deals with the growing weight and temptation of the Ring, just as a PO must deal with external and internal pressures to maintain focus on delivering value.

### 5. Mount Doom (Final Increment)

At the decisive moment, Frodo fails to destroy the Ring, succumbing to its temptation. However, the presence of Gollum—an unexpected factor—leads to the destruction of the Ring, highlighting that even with human failures, the ultimate goal can be achieved in unforeseen ways. This final event highlights the complexity of the PO’s role, where vision and purpose are more important than any individual action.

## Frodo’s Resilience as a PO

Frodo, as the Product Owner, symbolizes perseverance and commitment to the product vision. His journey is marked by extreme challenges that test his determination, his morality, and his ability to lead the mission. He faces the corruption of the Ring, physical and mental fatigue, and the constant threat of failure, but he continues to move forward toward the ultimate goal.

Even when he seems alone, Frodo finds support in Sam, his closest “development team,” who ensures that the vision is maintained until the end. This support is crucial for any PO, who must trust the team to execute the necessary tasks and achieve the greater goal.



> Frodo, as the Product Owner of the Scrum  Society, represents the essence of leadership through vision and commitment to purpose. His journey mirrors the responsibilities, challenges, and rewards a PO faces throughout a project, making him an epic example of how to guide a team toward success.
