Pippin symbolizes the developer who, even without experience or deep knowledge at the beginning, is able to learn, adapt, and make significant contributions when needed most.

## Pippin’s Role in the Analogy

### 1. Inexperienced but Determined Member of the Development Team

Pippin begins the journey as one of the least experienced members of the Fellowship of the Ring, often acting impulsively and without fully understanding the consequences. In Scrum, he represents the junior developer or new team member who, despite his initial inexperience, has the potential to grow into a valuable member of the team through learning and experience.

### 2. Impulsivity and Learning



Pippin often acts impulsively, which, while causing some problems at first, also leads to opportunities for learning and growth. He symbolizes the team member who learns from his mistakes and grows throughout the project, becoming more aware of his actions and how they impact the team and the project.
