Samwise Gamgee, or simply Sam, plays the crucial role of a development team member. **He is the constant support and driving force that ensures that the Product Owner (Frodo) can continue his mission, even in the face of the most difficult challenges**. Sam symbolizes the commitment, loyalty, and dedication that are essential for any successful Scrum team.

## Samwise Gamgee’s Role in the Analogy

### 1. Development Team Member

Sam is the development team member who is always by the Product Owner’s (Frodo’s) side, ensuring that the work gets done, even when the odds seem insurmountable. He is the perfect example of a developer who not only performs the assigned tasks, but also takes on additional responsibilities to support the larger mission.

### 2. Support and Resilience Provider

Sam is Frodo’s emotional and physical anchor, providing the support he needs at every step of the way. In Scrum, this translates into a team member who is always ready to help, solve problems, and motivate others, especially the PO, to continue toward the end goal.

### 3. Quality Assurance

Sam is meticulous and committed to quality in everything he does, whether it’s taking care of Frodo’s health or planning the next step in the journey. In a Scrum team, he represents the developer who cares about the quality of the product and the effectiveness of the process, ensuring that each task is carried out in the best possible way.

## Important Events and the Role of Samwise Gamgee

### 1. The Departure from the Shire (Initial Sprint and Ongoing Support)

From the beginning, Sam joins Frodo on the mission, symbolizing a member of the development team who commits to the project from the first sprint. He provides emotional and logistical support, ensuring that Frodo is prepared and motivated for the journey. As a dedicated developer, Sam anticipates the PO’s needs and is always ready to help.

### 2. Bearing the Burden (Sprint 2: Supporting at Critical Moments)

As the journey progresses and the burden of the Ring becomes heavier for Frodo, Sam takes on more and more responsibility to ease the burden on the PO. This is reflected in the way he takes care of both their survival, dealing with practical issues such as food and rest, ensuring that Frodo can focus on the mission. A member of the Scrum Team would do the same, taking on extra tasks to ensure the project continues without interruption.

### 3. The Rescue at Cirith Ungol (Removing Impediments)

When Frodo is captured by orcs at Cirith Ungol, Sam plays the role of removing a major impediment. He rescues Frodo, who is incapacitated, reflecting the work of a developer who faces and overcomes major technical or logistical challenges to ensure the project can continue. Your courage and determination here are critical to the team’s success.

### 4. The Trail to Mount Doom (Final Sprint: Physical and Emotional Support)

{{< figure class="center" src="/img/sam/sam-carring-frodo.jfif" alt="Sam literally carries Frodo when he can no longer carry himself" caption="Created with [**Image creator**](https://www.bing.com/images/create?)" >}}


On the final journey to Mount Doom, Sam literally carries Frodo when he can no longer carry himself, famously saying, “I can’t carry the Ring for you, but I can carry you.” This is a clear example of a Development Team member doing everything in his power to ensure that the Product Owner and the team achieve the goal. Sam takes on both the physical and emotional labor, ensuring that the mission reaches its completion.

### 5. The Completion of the Mission (Delivering the Final Increment)

Even when all seems lost at Mount Doom, Sam remains by Frodo’s side, ensuring that the Final Increment — destroying the Ring — is achieved. He not only supports Frodo until the very end, but also helps him escape after the destruction of the Ring, symbolizing a team member who does not abandon the project until it is complete and delivered.

### 6. Return to the Shire and the Final Retrospective (Reflection and Continuous Improvement)

After the quest is complete, Sam returns to the Shire with Frodo, where he participates in the final retrospective of the journey. He reflects on the challenges overcome and the lessons learned, just as a Scrum team member would do when reviewing what worked well and what could be improved for future projects. Sam applies these lessons to his own life, establishing a family and helping to rebuild the Shire, symbolizing continuous improvement.
