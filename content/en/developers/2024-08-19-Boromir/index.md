Boromir represents the role of **a development team member who is highly competent and experienced, but who faces internal and external conflicts that can hinder the progress of the project**. Boromir symbolizes the developer who possesses great technical skill and knowledge, but who can be influenced by external pressures or personal desires, which can lead to challenges within the Scrum team.

## Boromir's Role in the Analogy

### 1. Skilled and Experienced Developer

Boromir is a skilled and experienced warrior, respected for his bravery and knowledge in combat. In Scrum, he represents the team member who has great technical competence and experience, being able to solve complex problems and contribute significantly to the progress of the project.

### 2. External Influences and Pressures

Boromir is constantly pressured by the responsibility of protecting his people, Gondor, and sees the Ring as a solution to his kingdom's difficulties. This desire to use the Ring for his own benefit symbolizes how a developer can be influenced by external pressures, such as company expectations or personal goals, which can conflict with the goals of the Scrum team.

### 3. Internal and Team Conflicts

Boromir's increasing temptation to use the Ring generates internal conflicts and also with the other members of the Fellowship, especially with Frodo. In Scrum, this represents the developer who, despite their good intentions and skills, can cause tensions within the team due to conflicts of interest or vision, potentially diverting the team's focus from the main objectives.

## Important Events and Boromir’s Role

### 1. The Council of Elrond (Introduction and Statement of Intent)

At the Council of Elrond, Boromir advocates using the Ring as a weapon against Sauron, showing his intentions and concerns from the beginning. This moment represents a developer who, upon joining a Scrum project, may have ideas or goals that differ from the team’s consensus. While his intentions are good, these differences can cause challenges if they are not aligned with the team’s goals.

### 2. The Crossing of Caradhras and Moria (Demonstration of Skill and Resilience)

Boromir demonstrates his strength and skill during the difficult crossing of Caradhras and in the battle against the Orcs in Moria. This event symbolizes the Scrum team member who, through his technical competence, helps overcome significant challenges, showing that he is a valuable resource in difficult situations.

### 3. The Temptation and Fall in Parth Galen (Conflict and Bad Decision)

In Parth Galen, Boromir succumbs to the temptation of the Ring and tries to take it from Frodo, leading to his eventual downfall. This moment represents how a developer, even a highly skilled one, can be driven by personal desires or external pressures to make decisions that are not aligned with the interests of the team or the project. This can lead to internal conflicts within the team and deviations from the project's focus.


### 4. The Sacrifice to Protect Merry and Pippin (Redemption and Final Contribution)

{{< figure class="center" src="/img/boromir/boromir-merry-pippin.jfif" alt="Boromir redeems himself by fighting bravely to protect Merry and Pippin from the Uruk-hai" caption="Created with [**Image creator**](https://www.bing.com/images/create?)" >}}

After his mistake, Boromir redeems himself by fighting bravely to protect Merry and Pippin from the Uruk-hai, sacrificing his life in the process. This sacrifice symbolizes how a Scrum team member, despite previous mistakes, can seek redemption by contributing meaningfully and selflessly to the team's success, even if it means acknowledging his faults and making personal sacrifices.

### 5. Boromir’s Death and the Breakup of the Fellowship (Recognition and Lasting Impact)

Boromir’s death and subsequent breakup of the Fellowship of the Ring represent the lasting impact he had on the team, both through his contributions and the challenges he caused. In Scrum, this symbolizes how the departure of a key team member, even if it caused conflict, can have a profound impact on the rest of the team, influencing the progress and future dynamics of the project.

## Boromir’s Duality in Scrum

Boromir in the Sprint Fellowship is an example of a developer who possesses great skill and knowledge, but who also faces internal and external challenges that can harm the team. His journey illustrates the importance of alignment with the team’s goals and the need to recognize and overcome external pressures that can lead to detrimental decisions.

He represents the complexity of the role of an experienced developer on a Scrum team, where technical skill must be balanced with collaboration and adherence to the team’s goals. Boromir’s story is a reminder that even the most capable team members need to be wary of external temptations and pressures that can derail the team.



> Boromir, in the Scrum Society analogy, is the skilled and experienced developer who faces both internal and external challenges, symbolizing the importance of staying focused on the good of the team and the project. His story is a cautionary tale about the dangers of external pressures and the importance of collaboration and alignment within the Scrum team, showing that even the strongest team members can go astray if they are not fully committed to the shared goals.
