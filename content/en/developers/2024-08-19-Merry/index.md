Meriadoc “Merry” Brandebuque portrays the role of a **development team member who, despite being initially underestimated, proves to be critical to the team’s success through his intelligence, courage, and adaptability**. Merry demonstrates that even members who are not initially seen as essential can have a profound impact on the success of a project. He exemplifies a developer who, throughout the project, finds ways to contribute meaningfully by taking on responsibilities that go beyond what is expected.


## Merry’s Role in the Analogy

### 1. Underrated but Essential Member of the Development Team

Merry begins the journey as a team member who is underestimated due to his lack of experience and apparent skills. However, he quickly demonstrates that his intelligence, courage, and willingness to learn make him a vital part of the team. In Scrum, Merry symbolizes the developer who, while perhaps not the most experienced or technical, makes up for it with intelligence, creativity, and a deep commitment to the success of the project.

### 2. Continuous Learning and Growth

Merry grows considerably throughout the journey, both in terms of skills and courage. He represents the Scrum team member who is constantly learning, always looking for ways to improve his skills and increase his contribution to the team. His journey is a metaphor for the personal and professional growth that can occur during a Scrum project.

### 3. Collaboration and Initiative

Merry is an active collaborator who joins other team members to achieve goals. He takes the initiative in critical moments, showing that even the youngest or most inexperienced team members can play important roles when the situation demands it. In Scrum, he symbolizes the developer who, with initiative and a willingness to collaborate, becomes an invaluable asset to the team.


## Important Events and Merry's Role

### 1. The Initial Journey with the Fellowship (Team Integration and Adaptation)

At the beginning of the journey with the Fellowship of the Ring, Merry, along with Pippin, is seen as a less experienced member. However, he quickly adapts to the pace of the mission and begins to understand his role within the team. This beginning symbolizes the process of integration and adaptation of a new member of the Scrum team, who, despite being less experienced, begins to find his place and contribute in a significant way.

### 2. Encountering the Ents in Fangorn (Identifying Resources and Opportunities)

{{< figure class="center" src="/img/merry/merry-treebeard.jfif" alt="Merry with Treebeard" caption="Created with [**Image creator**](https://www.bing.com/images/create?)" >}}


Merry, along with Pippin, finds himself in Fangorn and befriends Treebeard, the leader of the Ents. They persuade the Ents to get involved in the war against Saruman. This event represents Merry's role as a developer who identifies unexpected resources and opportunities (such as the involvement of the Ents) and uses them to help the team achieve its goals. It shows that initiative and the ability to recognize opportunities are crucial in a Scrum environment.

### 3. The Battle of Helm's Deep and the March of the Ents (Strategic Contribution)

Merry and Pippin, by motivating the Ents to march against Isengard, end up playing a crucial strategic role in the war. This moment symbolizes how a team member, even without great experience, can make a significant strategic contribution, aligning external resources with the Scrum team's goal and directly impacting the project's success.

### 4. The Oath of Service to Théoden (Taking on New Responsibilities)

Merry swears loyalty to King Théoden of Rohan, taking on a new role as a squire. This oath represents Merry’s willingness to take on new responsibilities within the team, reflecting the behavior of a developer who is willing to expand their roles and responsibilities for the good of the project. In Scrum, this symbolizes flexibility and a willingness to learn and take on new roles as needed.

### 5. The Battle of the Pelennor Fields (Decisive Action and Courage)

{{< figure class="center" src="/img/merry/merry-eowyn.jfif" alt="Merry and Eowyn defeat the Witch-king of Angmar" caption="Created with [**Image creator**](https://www.bing.com/images/create?)" >}}

During the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, Merry plays a critical role in helping Éowyn defeat the Witch-king of Angmar. He stabs the Witch-king, allowing Éowyn to finish him off. This courageous and decisive action shows that Merry, despite his small stature and lack of military experience, plays a key role in the victory. In Scrum, this represents a team member who, even in challenging situations, finds ways to make a decisive contribution to the success of the project.

### 6. The Journey Back to the Shire (Applying Knowledge Learned)

After the war, Merry returns to the Shire with the other hobbits, where he uses the skills and knowledge gained during the journey to help free the Shire from Saruman. This event symbolizes the application of the knowledge and experience gained during the Scrum project to new contexts or future projects. Merry demonstrates that the learning gained during a project can be applied to meet new challenges and contribute to future success.

## Merry’s Intelligence and Courage

Merry, in the Sprint Fellowship, is an example of a team member who, although initially underestimated, becomes essential through his intelligence, courage, and willingness to learn. His ability to identify opportunities, take on new responsibilities, and act decisively at critical moments makes him an invaluable asset to the Scrum team.

He represents the idea that all team members, regardless of their initial experience, have the potential to make significant contributions. Merry’s journey is a reminder that with dedication and courage, even those who start out as newbies can become key players in a project’s success.



> Merry, in the Scrum Society analogy, is the team member who grows and develops throughout the journey, surpassing initial expectations to make strategic and decisive contributions. His intelligence, courage, and willingness to learn and take on new responsibilities make him an inspiring example of how each member of the Scrum Team can have a profound impact on the success of the project.
